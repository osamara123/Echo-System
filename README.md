# ECHO GENERATION AND CANCELLATION (Signals and Systems)

1. The task of this ECHO system is to generate and cancel both types of single and infinite ECHO using different methods.
2. I have added voice.m4a to the repository which include continious signal of my voice to perform echo system functions on it.
3. You can run matlab provided codes to hear the outputted generated voice in your directiry and compare my orginal signal voice to edited ones by the system.

## See attached phots below for quic comparison and evaluation.
